A temperature sensing alarm 

This project uses the following hardware components: 

1) Arduino Uno 
2) Temperature sensors
3) Piezo buzzer
4) RGB Led 

The basic idea behind this project was to adapt as many arduino function/features as possible. The project has successfuly incorprated : 
1)	Digital I/O – Switch
2)  Digital I/O – Switch
3)  Digital I/0 – LED 
4)  Analog Input 
5)  Analog Output (PWM):   
6)  Serial I/O 
7)  LCD 
8)  Timers

A temperture sensor senses the temperature, which is displayed on the LCD. Once the temperature gets above a certain temperature, the buzzer starts beeping ( like a fire alarm would). The led changes color according to the temperature. The application restarts only when the temperature decreases below a certain point. 

A video explaining the working has been uploaded on youtube ( https://youtu.be/n6E_X6ZIdn0 ) and TinkerCad (https://www.tinkercad.com/things/lXIWcwqrYtP-n10337032microcontroller/editel?sharecode=kcN2hVyPElU7cCOUwe-EBRpWkRKep9HgUGUHAGy25hw)
